# Lite Embed Extension

Author: Dennis Meiderwijk, Bob den Otter

A lightweight extension to display Youtube and Vimeo embeds.

Installation:

```bash
composer require bolt/lite-embed
```

After installation, in your twig file, you can use the `{{ lite_embed() }}` function to add your Youtube and Vimeo links.

`{{ lite_embed('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ') }}`

`{{ lite_embed('https://vimeo.com/10551329') }}`
